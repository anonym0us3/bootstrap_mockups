#Bootstrap Mockups

Please refer to the three mockup images in the [mockups folder](/mockups).

Work in pairs.

Your goal is to build three different page layouts using the Boostrap CSS Framework. You will need to dig into their documentation on [Bootstrap CSS classes](http://getbootstrap.com/css/) and [Bootstrap components](http://getbootstrap.com/components/) (a combination of CSS & JavaScript). Take some time to review the different styles/components bootstrap makes available to you.

A solution to this lab can be found in the *Solutions Branch*.

## Hints
* Don't forget to include jQuery and Bootstrap (CSS + Javascript) in the `head` of your project (jQuery is a dependency of bootstrap).
* Don't forget to wrap everything (except the nav bar) in a `<div class='container'>` tag.
* For placeholder images, try [placekitten](https://placekitten.com/) or [lorempixel](http://lorempixel.com). (340x200 should work fine).
* For dummy text, check out [Lorem Ipsum](http://www.lipsum.com/).
* For icons, take a look at Bootstrap's Glyphicons. For more common symbols, use HTML Symbols.
